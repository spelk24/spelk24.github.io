## About Me
<hr>
My name is Stephen Pelkofer. I work on the Analytics team for Sentry Insurance, and I'm also completing my M.S. in Analytics at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

This is my personal page that includes my contact information, learning resources that I've used, and personal projects that I've worked on either for school or for fun. The site is pretty new still (~April 2020), but I will continue to add new projects to the portfolio section as time permits.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
