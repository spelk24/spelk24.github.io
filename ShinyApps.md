### NBA Player Defensive Clusters (4/12/2020)

**Description:** Defensive Cluster analysis for current NBA players - This was a group project for my CSE 6242 Data & Visual Analytics course in Spring 2020 and included four other classmates.

The appplication used a cluster model and t-SNE to visualize similar NBA players, but only considered defensive stats. The stats included normal box score stats, and shots defended by distance. All data was scraped from [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com).
