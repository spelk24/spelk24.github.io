## About Me
<hr>
My name is Stephen Pelkofer. I work on the Analytics team for Sentry Insurance, and I'm also completing my M.S. in Computational Data Analytics at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

This is my personal page that includes my contact information, learning resources that I've used, and personal projects that I've worked on either for school or for fun. Most of my content is focused on machine learning and data visualization of datasets that I find interesting (sports, economics, politics, social justice, etc.). If you have any interesting datasets or problems, please send them my way!
