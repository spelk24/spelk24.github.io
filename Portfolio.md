### Grad School Weekly Hours - CSE 6242 Data & Visual Analytics

**Type:** Data Viz

**Description:** A simple graph that shows how much time goes into just 3 graduate credits at Georgia Tech. I use a technique called [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) when studying/working. It allows me to keep track of how many hours I'm _really_ spending on school work per week - it's also very effective for staying focused on getting stuff down, so I'd highly recommend trying it out.

**Built With:** R

Here is what my Spring 2020 semester looked like - this is only strict pomodoro time, and does not include extra reading or supplemental material. When someone asks me why I only take 3 credits per semester on top of working full-time, this is what I'll show them.

### NBA Player Defensive Comparisons (4/12/2020)

**Type:** Website/Application

**Description:** Defensive player comparison analysis for current NBA players - This was a group project for my CSE 6242 Data & Visual Analytics course in Spring 2020 and included four other classmates.

The application used a KNN model and t-SNE to visualize similar NBA players, but only considered defensive stats. The stats included normal box score stats, and shots defended by distance. All data was scraped from [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com).

**Built With:** R and Shiny
