### Grad School Weekly Hours - CSE 6242 Data & Visual Analytics

<hr>

**Type:** Data Viz

**Description:** A simple graph that shows how much time goes into just 3 graduate credits at Georgia Tech. I use a technique called [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) when studying/working. It allows me to keep track of how many hours I'm _really_ spending on school work per week - it's also very effective for staying focused on getting stuff down, so I'd highly recommend trying it out.

**Built With:** R

Here is what my Spring 2020 semester looked like - this is only strict pomodoro time, and does not include extra reading or supplemental material. When someone asks me why I only take 3 credits per semester on top of working full-time, this is what I'll show them.

### NBA Player Defensive Comparisons

<hr>

**Type:** Website/Application

**Description:** Defensive player comparison analysis for current NBA players - This was a group project for my CSE 6242 Data & Visual Analytics course in Spring 2020 and included four other classmates.

The application used a KNN model and t-SNE to visualize similar NBA players, but only considered defensive stats. The stats included normal box score stats, and shots defended by distance. All data was scraped from [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com).

**Built With:** R and Shiny

### Google Cloud & NCAAÂ® ML Competition 2019-Men's

<hr>

**Description:** Annual Kaggle competition for the men's and women's basketball NCAA tournaments. This was my first time competing in a Kaggle competition - Out of the 866 teams, I placed 444 (52nd percentile). About 90% of my coding time was spent doing data-prep and figuring out what features I could use. I ended up using a Logistic Regression classifier. At the time, my machine learning background was not as strong, but I'm looking forward to competing in 2021 with an advanced skill-set.

**Built With:** Python
