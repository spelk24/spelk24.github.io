# Poverty Rates by Race in the US

2020 has given me a lot more free-time than I'm used to. I've been trying to use that time for personal development, learning, and reading. The two best things I've done so far are (1) read [*The Color of Law by Richard Rothstein*](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-color-of-law-a-forgotten-history-of-how-our-government-segregated-america/) and (2) read [*Evicted by Matthew Desmond*](https://www.evictedbook.com/). Both books have been eye opening to the gruesome realities of the history of the United States. One was focused primarily on housing segregation, and the unethical actions that government officials took in the 20th century to ensure the separation and oppression of black people. The other book is about real poverty in America; specifically in Milwaukee, WI. The author documents the lives of poor families that struggle to survive in a broken system, where most decisions are made out of desperation to keep a roof over their head. 

In different ways, each book inspired me to want to look at some data around racial inequality and poverty. I decided to look at some US Census data from the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs), specifically focusing on poverty rates by race in US counties. Some of the numbers are mind-blowing and sad. In hopes to inspire more people to care about these issues, I tried to build some visualizations that represent the problems millions of people face.

This first chart shows the distribution of 2018 poverty rates for white people and black people in US counties with more than 10,000 people. It's very easy to see that the distributions are different. The median for white poverty rates is around 15%, while it's closer to 27% for black people. That is a remarkable difference, but one that is explained in great detail in *The Color of Law*. For decades, black people were denied to live in suburbs with well-funded education systems, and were forced to live in poor neighborhoods where housing values do not increase. Because of government actions, generations of white people have had a much easier path to gaining and sustaining wealth. I specifically call out Milwaukee County in this chart, because the gap between black and white poverty rate is so large (23.7%!).

If we look at the black-white poverty gap in the 20 largest US counties, the minimum gap is 3.1% (Kings County) and the maximum is 19.3% (Wayne County, MI). The black poverty rate of 33.7% in Wayne County (Michigan) represents almost 230,000 people that live below the poverty line.

I was also particularly interested in looking at the poverty rates in Wisconsin's two biggest counties. It's nationally know that Milwaukee is one of the [most segregated cities in the US](https://www.governing.com/topics/politics/gov-milwaukee-most-segregated-polarized-place.html). In both Milwaukee County and Dane County in 2018, the black-white poverty gap was larger than **all** of the top 20 counties in the country.

Looking at this data can be depressing. It's disheartening to learn that over 33% of black people in the county I grew up in live below the poverty line. If you're interested in what it looks like to live in poverty, I encourage you to read the 2nd book that I pointed out - *Evicted*. If you're interested in the research on how we got here, and how we can work to fix it, please check out *The Color of Law*.
