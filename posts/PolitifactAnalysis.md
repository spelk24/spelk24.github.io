Politifact is one of my favorite websites. They describe their work as "fact-checking journalism", which is something that is really needed in today's day and age. Here is a quote directly from their website about their process: "PolitiFact seeks to present the true facts, unaffected by agenda or biases. Our journalists set their own opinions aside as they work to uphold principles of independence and fairness." To learn more about politifact, check out their website here: [politifact.com](https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/).

I'm a weekly (and sometimes daily) user of politifact. My beliefs and core values are pretty set in stone, but I do like to check that the people I support and vote for are telling the truth and not spreading incorrect information. I wanted to make some comparisons between political parties with the fact-checking data that politifact has. The data I scraped is as of 4/23/2020, so the individual numbers could be off depending on when you're reading this.For this analysis, I stuck with comparing Donald Trump (Republican) to the most prominent Democratic voices and leaders (as shown in the graph below). It's important to note that the sample size differences are pretty large in some cases - for example, Barack Obama (Democrat) and Donald Trump have been fact-checked much more frequently than the others - this is largely because Presidents are generally in the spotlight more. In Trump's case, he makes a lot of statements that are possibly misleading, so he gets fact-checked more than anyone. The time period for the analysis is the entire time politifact.com has been around (since 2007).

The graph below shows the percentage of fact checks that have proven to be *mostly false*, *false*, or a *pants-on-fire* lie. To no surprise, Donald Trump lies A LOT - 69% of his fact-checks result in at least *mostly false*. Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden (both Democrats) also have had their fair share of lies. Elizabeth Warren (Democrat) has only been checked 34 times, but she ends up with the lowest percentage of the group (16%) - her and Bernie Sanders (Democrat) have never been caught in a *pants-on-fire* lie.

I hope you enjoyed this quick analysis, and please always check out politifact for independent analysis of what our leaders are saying.
